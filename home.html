                Rick Riordan is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of over twenty
                novels for young readers, including the Percy Jackson series. For
                fifteen years, Rick taught English and history at public and private
                middle schools in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Texas.
            </p>

            <p>
                While teaching in San Antonio, Saint Mary’s Hall honored him with the
                school’s first Master Teacher Award. While teaching full time, Riordan
                began writing mystery novels for grownups.
            </p>

            <p>
                His Tres Navarre series went on to win the top three national awards in
                the mystery genre – the Edgar, the Anthony and the Shamus. Riordan
                turned to children’s fiction when he started The Lightning Thief as a
                bedtime story for his oldest son. Today, over 190 million copies of his
                books are in print worldwide, and rights have been sold into more than
                37 countries.

                Rick and his wife Becky are both executive producers overseeing TV/film
                adaptations of his works including Percy Jackson, the Kane Chronicles,
                and Daughter of the Deep. Rick Riordan now writes full-time. He lives in

                <p>As the son of Hades, Nico di Angelo has been through so much, from the premature deaths of his mother
