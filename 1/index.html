                First volume of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians saga, The Money Thief
                rays was among the first places on the list of the most popular series
                sold from The New York Times. The author combines legends of
                Greek mythology with adventures in the 21st century. In them, the gods of
                Olympus are still alive, they still fall in love with mortals and generate
                children half gods, half human, like the heroes of Greece
                old. Marked by destiny, they hardly go beyond
                adolescence. Few manage to discover their identity.

                Problem boy Percy Jackson is one of them. Have experience
                strange places in which mythological gods and monsters seem to jump out of
                pages of books straight into your life. Worse than that: some
                These creatures are quite irritated. A precious artifact
                was stolen from Mount Olympus and Percy is the prime suspect. For
                restore peace, he and his friends – young modern heroes –
                will have to do more than capture the real thief: they will have to
                elucidate a betrayal more threatening than the fury of the gods.

                A call from his friend Grover leaves Percy ready for another
                mission: two new half-bloods have been found, and their
                ancestry is still unknown. As always, Percy knows that
                will need to rely on the power of their hero allies, their loyal
                sword Riptide... and a little lift from his mother. What they
                still don't know is that the young people discovered are not the only ones in
                danger: Kronos, the Lord of the Titans, devised one of his plans
                more treacherous, and our heroes will be easy prey. A monster
                ancestor has been awakened - a being with enough power to
                destroy Olympus -, and Artemis, the only goddess capable of
                find it, it disappeared. Percy and his friends only have one
                week to rescue the kidnapped goddess and solve the mystery
                that haunts the monster she hunted.

                Mount Olympus is in danger. Cronos, the wicked titan who was
                dethroned and torn to pieces by the twelve Olympian gods,
                prepares a triumphant return. The first step of your troops will be
                attack and destroy the training camp of the heroes, sons of
                gods with mortals, who since Ancient Greece have fought on the line of

                To ensure that the refuge of demigods, the Camp
                Half-Blood, don't be invaded, Percy Jackson, Tyson, Annabeth and
                Grover are assigned to an important mission: stop the forces
                of Kronos before they approach the camp, in the tangle of
                corridors of the feared Labyrinth of Daedalus – an endless
                underground universe that, at every turn, reveals the most
                terrifying surprises.

                The half-bloods spent the entire year preparing for the
                battle against the Titans, and they know that the chances of victory are
                small. Kronos' army is more powerful than ever, and
                each new god or demigod that joins the cause grants more strength
                to the vengeful titan.
