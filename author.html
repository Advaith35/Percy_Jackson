                    Rick Riordan is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of over twenty
                    novels for young readers, including the Percy Jackson series. For
                    fifteen years, Rick taught English and history at public and private
                    middle schools in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Texas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While teaching in San Antonio, Saint Mary’s Hall honored him with the
                    school’s first Master Teacher Award. While teaching full time, Riordan
                    began writing mystery novels for grownups.
                </p>

                <p>
                    His Tres Navarre series went on to win the top three national awards in
                    the mystery genre – the Edgar, the Anthony and the Shamus. Riordan
                    turned to children’s fiction when he started The Lightning Thief as a
                    bedtime story for his oldest son. Today, over 190 million copies of his
                    books are in print worldwide, and rights have been sold into more than
                    37 countries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rick and his wife Becky are both executive producers overseeing TV/film
                    adaptations of his works including Percy Jackson, the Kane Chronicles,
                    and Daughter of the Deep. Rick Riordan now writes full-time. He lives in
                    Boston with his wife and two sons.

                                    State (because I thought I wanted to be a guitar player and they had the best music
                                    program), but then transferred to the University of Texas at Austin. Graduated with

                                    The first book I remember reading for fun was the Lord of the Rings. I probably read
                                    it
                                    ten times. I also liked Greek and Norse mythology since I was in middle school. I
                                    read
                                    mostly fantasy and science fiction in high school, then got interested in mysteries
                                    when
                                    I got to college. My parents were both teachers. My mom was a musician and an
                                    artist,
                                    too. My dad was a ceramicist (he made stuff out of clay), so I grew up in a very
                                    artistic family. I started writing when I was in middle school. The first story I
                                    submitted for publication was when I was 13. It wasn’t published. My first published
                                    works were two short stories in the UTSA literary magazine.

                                    was teaching middle school in New Braunfels, Texas. After that, my wife and I moved

                                    San Francisco. We lived there for eight years and I taught at Presidio Hill School.
                                    Then
                                    we had our two sons, Haley and Patrick, and we moved back home to San Antonio. I

                                    at Saint Mary’s Hall (English and social studies, grades 6-8) for six years, then
                                    stopped teaching to become a full-time writer. I taught mythology almost every year
                                    that
                                    I was a teacher. It was always my favorite thing, and the students always liked it,
